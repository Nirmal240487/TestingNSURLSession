# Testing `NSURLSession`

This repo accompanies a series of blog posts covering [how to test `NSURLSession` with Swift](http://masilotti.com/testing-nsurlsession/). Each post covers a different aspect of the testing process.

First, learn how to verify that you send the right parameters to the session. Next, speed up your test suite by making all `NSURLSession` API calls synchronous. Finally, tie it all together by stubbing JSON responses when running UI Tests.
